# Professional README Generator

The README Generator is a **command-line interface (CLI)** application built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [npm package Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). It was created to simplify the process of creating a README file for a project by prompting the user with a series of questions about their project. Once the user has answered all the prompts, the README file is automatically generated and saved in the **Generated file** directory.

Creating a good README file is important as it provides critical information about the project, including its purpose, how to install and use it, and how to contribute to it. However, writing a good README file can be time-consuming and often neglected. With the README Generator, users can quickly and easily create a README file that meets their project's needs.
